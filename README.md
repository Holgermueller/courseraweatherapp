# Weather App for Coursera

This is a solution to the [Coursera Weather App](https://www.coursera.org/learn/showcase-build-a-website-api-html-javascript-json/supplement/uKwPr/the-project-scenario) project.

## Overview

## My Process

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)
- [CSS Nano](https://cssnano.github.io/cssnano/)
- [7Timer! weather api](https://www.7timer.info/doc.php)

### What I learned

This project required me to pull data from a csv file to populate the options of an HTML selector. Rather than going through the painstaking process of hardcoding the data into the options, or manually converting the data into a JSON object, I researched how to convert the data with javascript. Once I did this, I realized the line for Gibraltar had no value for the country column, so I had to figure out how to account for that as well.
